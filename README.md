# Audio-visual deepfake detection
Deepfake videos, with advanced AI, graphics and other such methods tend to manipulate visual, auditory information and thus pose a great threat to the personal and proprietary infringement. This is an issue rapidly developing as the various generative models and AI advances rapidly.

This, in turn, makes the work of deepfake detection more tough, as with this rapid advance such attacks attempt to pass through even the most advanced detection applications. Such a situation warrants more advanced tools that overcome the complexity of ever advancing tech in deepfake domain.

Our approach involves analysing, implementing and attempting to improve the work of 2022 paper [Audio-visual person-of-interest deepfake detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03083.pdf) with the use of FakeForensics++ dataset and by further fine tuning parameters, trying to further augment the results and measuring the same with metric of AUC.

This, we hope contributes to the global body of knowledge in deepfake detection and provides practical insights for developing more robust and reliable detection systems.
