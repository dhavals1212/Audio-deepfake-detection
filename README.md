# Traffic light detection
Detection of traffic light through annotated data, we can easily obtain great reliable results for driving mechanisms which are autonomous. The dataset for this purpose used here is lisa traffic light detection dataset comprising of 7 classes including the day and night training features as well.

Yolo version 8 used here, is the most recent development in the YOLO models that help facilitate the great object detection capabilities.

This project aims to fine tune YOLO 8 and in addition tries to do some additional experiments as well to reach better overall project optimality.
