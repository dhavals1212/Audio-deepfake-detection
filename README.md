# Traffic light detection
Detection of traffic light through annotated data, we can easily obtain great reliable results for driving mechanisms which are autonomous. The dataset for this purpose used here is lisa traffic light detection dataset comprising of 7 classes including the day and night training features as well.

Yolo version 8 used here, is the most recent development in the YOLO models that help facilitate the great object detection capabilities.

This project aims to fine tune YOLO 8 and in addition tries to do some additional experiments as well to reach better overall project optimality.

# LISA Traffic Light Detection dataset

This is a widely used dataset for traffic light detection and originally contains many more than 3 main classes of go, warning and stop but to improve the overall model performance time, it was reduced to these 3 main classes and also other reason for it is that other classes are not that useful either when it comes to detection.

# YOLO8

In the YOLO (You only live once) series of architectures that the industry has observed over the years, we see that the latest is YOLO 8, unlike its predecessor it is an independent library that comes as the easiest defined structures for training, validation and prediction of the object detection systems/features.

For all tasks of Detection, segmentation and classification, YOLO 8 outperforms previous versions.

It is modified version of Fast RCNN and has high capabilities in terms of using selective search and region proposal networks with which it accurately passes the layers to CNN architecture on generated feature maps.
