# Audio-deepfake-detection
Trying to reverse engineer the audio deepfake detection as the part of the project for the Vision and Perception class of University of Sapienza, Rome. The system is based on the 2022 paper of detection using the POI (person of interest) system feature extractor that is quite a good model for this attempt.
